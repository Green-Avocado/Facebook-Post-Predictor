    "##### Overview:\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "The market utility of social media platforms such as Facebook, which are able to generate mass revenues for cosmetic brands, has been an established and exploited advertising strategy in the digital age (Moro et. al, 2016). The goal of this project is to take a predictive analytical approach to determine which type of Facebook post (i.e., photo, video, status, or link) will engage the most internet-user engagement, determined through variables such as likes, post consumptions, and post total reach. The dataset which will be used for this analysis was acquired through an experimental data mining technique which included scraping data from the Facebook page of an internationally renowned cosmetics company on posts made between January 1st and December 31st (Moro et. al., 2016).\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "For the methodology, we will use the variables of the continuous numerical variables of total reaches (Lifetime_Post_Total_Reach) and the number of total impressions (Lifetime_Post_Total_Impressions), and the categorical variable of Facebook post (Type). First, we will look at the relationship between these variables in a scatter plot graph that will help us to formulate our hypothesis. Then, as we are trying to predict the type of post that will be the most successful, we will use a K-nearest neighbour classification analysis. To do so, we must determine the K value using cross-validation of the training data. Then, we will need to test the accuracy of the classifier with the testing data.\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "We expect to find that posts which include media, such as photos and videos, are more likely to engage users than other posts, such as statuses and links. This is based on the assumption that the former types of posts might be more likely to be shared and thus will have more exposure.\n",
    "It is beneficial for social media platforms to increase user engagement, as this is likely to increase revenue through advertising. Therefore, these findings may be used to choose what type of posts are prioritized to maximize user engagement.\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "These findings may lead to further exploration of how the contents of these posts impact user engagement. This may include the duration of a video, content of an image, length of a status, or details about the contents of a link. "
